This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors containing special characters. The `bug.R` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.R` offers a corrected approach.  The issue arises from how R's `%in%` operator handles comparisons with special characters within character vectors used for subsetting.  The solution involves careful handling of special characters or using alternative subsetting methods to avoid unexpected behavior.
